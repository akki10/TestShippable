# Repository Issue Statistics
<!-- Created By Akul Narang on 22nd July, 2016 -->
### Dependencies

Requires [Python](https://www.python.org/) v2.7 to run.

You need to install pygithub3 library for GitHub API v3:

```sh
$ sudo pip install pygithub3
```

### Improvements

 - It is just a python script. UI need to be built upon this.
 - Selecting repository's issues is a time taking process as the API queries on complete Table of Issues and then applies filters on them
